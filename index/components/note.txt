React
........
create a project: npx create-react-app appName

run a project : npm start

building blocks of  project
..........................
html
css
javascript(angular type script)


Angular                                                 React
..........                                              ........

-frame work of js                                       -library of javascript
-real DOM                                                - virtual DOM
-(runing tym is more                                      (run tym less not rerun the entire dom if we update)
becoz it complte rerun the
DOM if we update the dom )


Advantages of  React
.......................
1.REACT uses virtual DOM (faster )
2.reusable components
3.jsx (javascript  xml ie mixed up html and js )



components In react
.....................
1.class based:::::(Is a statefull components)
2.function based:::::(stateless components)


to add same content it occure error so alwys create a div ie parent before h1 content. 
or atleast use 'empty fragment <> </>'


statefull components
stateless components
 
 state
 ..........
 object used to store datas inside a components in react


 react hooks
 ...........
used to provide extra features (so introduce to functionbased for make it as a statefull componet)

useState - react


props(properties)
.................
used to share datas from  parent to child component

destruturing: no need to call props only call variable in {} at function and no need props.varible in html.

API CALL IN js...
.................


Ajax
........
-XmlHttp
-fetch
-asynch await


first working hook of a componet.
..................................
useEffect ---react


Redirection/Routing in react
............................
react-router-dom: - library used for Routing

Browser router- wrap the main componet inside Browser router component

router  : wrap the  componet inside router which need Redirection
Routers :wrap all the router if we set more than one componet paths 

link -a componet react -router -dom used for redirection

useParams-hook in react-dom used to access useParams



REDUX
.........


A------>B.......>C

coupling : PARENT to child data communication via another parent called coupling 

props drilling    : at the time data sharing from parent tochild if any imtermediate componet have  error occur then the data 
                    will stack there.


REDUX  : State management technology-- we need to reduce coupling and make all componet indepent 
to avoid props drilling

stores : dataa  are store in REDUX  so components can acces from store file


STORE.....>component...>ACTION....>REDUCER

Librarires for REDUX
........................
-REDUX
-react redux
-redux-thunk

for install : npm i redux react redux  redux-thunk

create store - method in redux used to create store

in redux middleware used o make redux as asynchronus (actuly redux is synchrounus function inside )

thunk- used to create middleware


HTTP METHODS IN REACT
............................
axios -library used to call API

first installl axios library


..> useDispatch - hook used to dispatch a function in a component


useSelector -hook used to access data from component
